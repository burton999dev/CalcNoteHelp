## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy outlines the approach of CalcNote, a calculator application, in handling personal data. We emphasize that CalcNote itself does not collect any personal information or location data from its users. However, it is important to note that third-party libraries used within the app may collect certain information. This policy aims to transparently convey how data is handled and the purposes for which it might be used.

## 2. Collection and Use of Personal Information
CalcNote is designed to prioritize user privacy. As such, the application itself does not gather any personal information including, but not limited to, names, email addresses, or location data. Nevertheless, CalcNote incorporates the following third-party libraries, which may collect information:

- Admob: Used for serving advertisements. Data collected may include user interaction with ads and anonymous identifiers.
- Firebase Analytics: Helps in understanding user behavior within the app by collecting anonymous data regarding app usage and interactions.
- Firebase Crashlytics: Utilized for monitoring app performance and identifying crashes. It collects data pertaining to app crashes and system information, which is vital for enhancing app stability.  

Each of these services operates under its own privacy policy and may process data in accordance with its guidelines. Users are encouraged to review the respective privacy policies of these services for more detailed information. It is important to clarify that while these services collect data for specific purposes such as advertising, analytics, and app performance, CalcNote itself remains a tool that does not independently gather personal user data.

## 3. Third-Party Data Processing
CalcNote incorporates several third-party services to enhance user experience and app functionality. These services, including Admob, Firebase Analytics, and Firebase Crashlytics, are governed by their respective privacy policies and data processing terms. They handle user data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable laws.

- Admob: Manages advertising data, ensuring targeted and relevant ads are displayed to users. For more information, please refer to the [Google Ads Data Processing Terms](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/dpa/dataprocessingamendment_20200816.html).
- Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics: Utilized for understanding user interactions within the app and maintaining app stability. Detailed information can be found in the [Firebase Data Processing Terms](https://firebase.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms).

We recommend users to review these documents to understand how their data is processed and safeguarded by these third-party services.

## 4. User Rights
Under the GDPR, users have specific rights regarding their personal data. These include:

- The Right to Access: Users can request information on how their data is being used and processed.
- The Right to Rectification: Users have the right to correct any incorrect or incomplete data held about them.
- The Right to Erasure: Also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’, this allows users to request the deletion of their data under certain circumstances.
- The Right to Restrict Processing: Users can request a halt on the processing of their data.
- The Right to Data Portability: This permits users to obtain and reuse their data for their own purposes across different services.
- The Right to Object: Users can object to the processing of their personal data in certain cases, such as for direct marketing purposes.  

CalcNote encourages users to exercise these rights as needed. For requests or inquiries regarding personal data, users can contact the relevant third-party service provider directly, as CalcNote does not process personal data on its own.

## 5. Data Protection
The safety and security of user data is a priority for CalcNote. While the application itself does not collect personal data, we ensure that third-party services integrated within the app adhere to strict data protection standards. These services are required to implement appropriate security measures to safeguard user data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. In the unlikely event of a data breach, the concerned third-party service will undertake necessary steps to mitigate any potential harm and will inform the affected users as required by law.

## 6. Changes to the Privacy Policy
CalcNote reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes to the policy will be communicated through the application or the official website, allowing users to review the updated terms. The revised policy will come into effect from the date of publication. We encourage users to periodically review the Privacy Policy to stay informed about how their data is being protected. Continued use of CalcNote following any changes to the Privacy Policy signifies acceptance of those changes.

## 7. Contact Information
For any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or the handling of personal data by the third-party services used in CalcNote, users are encouraged to contact us directly. Please send your inquiries to burton9999dev@gmail.com . We are committed to addressing your concerns and providing clarity on how user data is managed within the app.

Any dispute arising out of or related to the use of CalcNote or this Privacy Policy will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Japan.
