# CalcNote Pro

### 1. No more ads anywhere
All in-app ads disappear, giving you a smoother experience.

- The full-screen ad at launch (once every 6 hours) is removed, so you can start calculating immediately.
- Banner ads at the top of each screen vanish, letting you use more screen space.
- Native ads in the side menu and settings are hidden, so you can reach the features you need faster.

### 2. Full control over file history
<span style="font-size: 1.1em; vertical-align: middle;">Work on your files with greater peace of mind.</span>

- Every save is automatically recorded in the history. (**Even in the free plan the history is stored, so you can access past versions right after upgrading to Pro.**)
- View the history from the File manager and restore any save point you like.
- Easily recover files you deleted by mistake.

### 3. Floating widget available
A handy widget lets you calculate and take notes while other apps stay open.

- It appears as a translucent overlay, so you can check results or jot notes without interrupting your work.
- Launch it anytime with one tap from the status bar.
- For example, you can copy prices shown in your browser without switching apps.

### 4. Create unlimited User-defined Lists
You can create as many **User-defined Lists** as you like to organize frequently used values and units.

- The free plan limits you to one User-defined List; Pro lets you create unlimited lists.
- Switch lists for different purposes to dramatically boost your productivity.
