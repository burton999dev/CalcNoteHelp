# <a name ="introduction"> Introduction</a>
`CalcNote` is the the notepad calculator designed for smart phone. You can immediately obtain a calculation result while allowing recognition of a calculation process.  
If you make a mistake, you don't need to start again, you can edit your expression like in a text editor. Of course, you can write a memo for your problems.  
You can do multiple calculations at the same time, and edit previous lines at any time.  
CalcNote is only available on Android, and I don't have a plan to release CalcNote to iOS.  
Because  macOS and iOS have a great notepad calculator [Soulver](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/).  
I highly recommend [Soulver](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/) if you are using an iOS or macOS.  
I always use [Soulver](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/) on my mac.
CalcNote's user interface was inspired by the [Soulver](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/).

# <a name="version">Differences Between the Free Plan and the Pro Plan</a>
`CalcNote` is free to use, and you can upgrade to the Pro plan to enjoy a more powerful and comfortable experience.

The Free plan includes the following limitations:

- A banner ad is displayed at the top of the screen.
- An App Open Ad may appear when launching the app (up to once every 6 hours).
- Google Analytics is used to understand which features are frequently used so that I can improve `CalcNote`.  
  These analytics data are used **only** for app improvement.  
  **No personal information, device identifiers, or note contents are ever collected, and the app does not request any related permissions.**
- The [floating widget](floating_widget.md) feature is not available.
- The file version history and file restoration features are not available.
- Only one user-defined list can be created.

The subscription model was introduced in November 2025.  
Before that, `CalcNote Pro` was offered as a separate paid app.

If you have already purchased the Pro version, you can continue using all features **forever with no additional cost**.  
The Pro app will continue to receive updates just like the Free version.  
In other words, `CalcNote Pro` now functions as a **lifetime license edition**, and I will continue maintaining it.

Because of this, the Pro app is now priced very high.  
For new users, I strongly recommend subscribing via the in-app subscription in the Free version instead of purchasing the old Pro app.
