# <a name ="introduction"> Introduction</a>
`CalcNote` is the the notepad calculator designed for smart phone. You can immediately obtain a calculation result while allowing recognition of a calculation process.  
If you make a mistake, you don't need to start again, you can edit your expression like in a text editor. Of course, you can write a memo for your problems.  
You can do multiple calculations at the same time, and edit previous lines at any time.  
CalcNote is only available on Android, and I don't have a plan to release CalcNote to iOS.  
Because  macOS and iOS have a great notepad calculator [Soulver](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/).  
I highly recommend [Soulver](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/) if you are using an iOS or macOS.  
I always use [Soulver](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/) on my mac.
CalcNote's user interface was inspired by the [Soulver](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/).

Free edition has the same functionality as the Pro edition but it has the following restrictions.
