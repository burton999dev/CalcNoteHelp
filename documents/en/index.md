# <a name ="introduction"> Introduction</a>
`CalcNote` is the the notepad calculator designed for smart phone. You can immediately obtain a calculation result while allowing recognition of a calculation process.  
If you make a mistake, you don't need to start again, you can edit your expression like in a text editor. Of course, you can write a memo for your problems.  
You can do multiple calculations at the same time, and edit previous lines at any time.

# <a name ="version">Difference between Free and Pro editions</a>
There are two editions for the `CalcNote`, [Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burton999.notecal) and [Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burton999.notecal.pro) (JPY 360).  
Free edition has the same functionality as the Pro edition but it has the following restrictions.  

- Ads will be displayed on the top of screen.
- A dialog appears to promote user to rate the CalcNote at fixed intervals.
- We use analytics services to understand how users use `CalcNote` in order for CalcNote to improve its software.
- Can not use the [floating widget](floating_widget.md)

If you like the CalcNote, I hope you'll consider purchasing the Pro editon.
